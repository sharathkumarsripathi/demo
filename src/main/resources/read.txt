Slide 1: Title
Transition to a Single Source of Truth: Data De-duplication Strategy

Slide 2: Current State Overview
Multiple databases: MyQuest DB, PRS DB, COS DB
Duplicate demographic and identity records across systems
No unified source of truth
Data inconsistencies and operational inefficiencies

Slide 3: Transition State Overview
Introduction of integration layers (API Gateways, MDM, Analytical Datastores)
Batch jobs and data syncs between systems
Still potential for duplicate records during transition

Slide 4: Future State Vision
Centralized data layer (MDM, Analytical Datastores)
Single source of truth for identity and demographic data
Streamlined access for all modules and Quest systems

Slide 5: Challenges in the Transition Phase
Identifying duplicate records across MyQuest DB, PRS DB, COS DB
Ensuring data integrity during migration
Maintaining system availability and data consistency

Slide 6: Identifying Duplicate Records
Use Master Data Management (MDM) tools to:
Match records using unique identifiers (EID, PRS ID, MQID)
Apply fuzzy matching for names, DOB, contact info
Generate duplicate reports for manual review

Slide 7: Data De-duplication Process
Extract data from all relevant databases
Run deduplication algorithms (MDM, custom scripts)
Review and resolve conflicts (automated and manual)
Merge records and assign a single unique identifier (EID)
Update all downstream systems to reference the unified record

Slide 8: Maintaining a Single Source of Truth
Designate the MDM/Analytical Datastore as the authoritative source
Implement real-time and batch syncs to keep all systems updated
Enforce data governance policies for data entry and updates

Slide 9: Data Governance and Ongoing Maintenance
Regular audits for duplicates
Automated alerts for potential new duplicates
Continuous improvement of matching algorithms

Slide 10: Summary & Next Steps
Transition requires careful planning and robust tooling
MDM is key to resolving duplicates and establishing a single source of truth
Ongoing governance ensures data quality in the future state
