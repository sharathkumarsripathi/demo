**Transition to a Single Source of Truth: Data De-duplication Strategy**

---

## **Slide 1: Title**

**Transition to a Single Source of Truth: Data De-duplication & Governance Strategy**

* Ensuring accuracy, consistency, and trust in enterprise identity data

---

## **Slide 2: Current State Overview**

* Multiple disconnected databases: **MyQuest DB**, **PRS DB**, **COS DB**
* Duplicate and conflicting demographic/identity records across systems
* No authoritative source of truth
* Data inconsistencies leading to operational inefficiencies and user frustration

---

## **Slide 3: Transition State Overview**

* Introduction of integration layers: **API Gateways**, **MDM**, **Analytical Datastores**
* Batch jobs and syncs reduce—but do not eliminate—duplicates
* Coexistence of legacy and new systems during migration period
* Temporary crosswalk tables to map legacy IDs to new **Epic Identity IDs**

---

## **Slide 4: Future State Vision**

* Centralized **Epic Identity** and **MDM** as the single source of truth
* All Epic modules and Quest systems consume identity data from one authoritative source
* Real-time and batch updates ensure system-wide consistency
* Improved data accuracy, reduced maintenance, and enhanced user experience

---

## **Slide 5: Challenges in the Transition Phase**

* Detecting and reconciling duplicate records across multiple databases
* Preserving data integrity during incremental migrations
* Maintaining high availability while refactoring dependencies
* Managing change for downstream systems reliant on legacy identifiers

---

## **Slide 6: Identifying Duplicate Records**

Use **MDM** capabilities to:

* Match records using unique IDs (**EID**, **PRS ID**, **MQID**)
* Apply fuzzy matching on names, DOB, contact info, and addresses
* Standardize formats before matching (name casing, phone normalization)
* Generate exception and conflict reports for human review

---

## **Slide 7: Data De-duplication Process**

1. **Extract**: Pull records from MyQuest DB, PRS DB, COS DB
2. **Profile**: Identify overlaps, anomalies, and quality issues
3. **Deduplicate**: Apply automated match/merge rules with MDM tools
4. **Resolve Conflicts**: Automated for high-confidence matches, manual for ambiguous cases
5. **Merge & Assign**: Create a single **Epic Identity (EID)** per individual
6. **Propagate**: Update all dependent systems to reference unified EIDs

---

## **Slide 8: Maintaining a Single Source of Truth**

* Designate **Epic Identity / MDM** as the sole authoritative identity store
* Enforce write operations through standardized APIs
* Implement both real-time and scheduled syncs
* Apply validation rules at entry points to prevent new duplicates

---

## **Slide 9: Data Governance and Ongoing Maintenance**

* Schedule regular audits for duplicate detection
* Automated alerts for suspected duplicates
* Version control and change logs for all identity records
* Continuous refinement of matching algorithms and governance policies

---

## **Slide 10: Summary & Next Steps**

* A well-governed **Epic Identity + MDM** framework is essential for high-quality, reliable identity data
* Deduplication is not a one-time task—it’s an ongoing process
* Next Steps:

  * Finalize field-level match/merge rules
  * Build data stewardship workflows
  * Train teams on governance and conflict resolution
  * Monitor and continuously improve matching accuracy
