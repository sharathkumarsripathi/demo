Solution Draft: Immediate Action Communication Approval Automation
1. Problem Statement
Clients are frustrated by the high volume and inconsistent quality of Immediate Action (IA) communications regarding test code changes and discontinuations. The current manual, email-based process lacks standardization, governance, and auditability.

2. Business Objective
Implement an automated, governed approval process for IA communications that:

Ensures all required information is collected in a standardized way
Automates routing and approval based on business rules
Documents and retains all approvals and supporting materials
Reduces unnecessary IA communications and client risk
3. Proposed Solution
Platform Recommendation
Evaluate and select a platform that supports workflow automation, form customization, and audit trails. Candidates:

Salesforce (recommended for integration with client management)
ServiceNow (strong workflow and audit capabilities)
SharePoint (if already widely used internally)
Key Features
Web-based Form: Standardized, dynamic form with required fields, dropdowns, and attachments.
Automated Routing: Approval workflow based on form responses (e.g., ETLO/NLO, within/outside Quest control).
Conditional Logic: Show/hide fields and options based on user input (e.g., “within Quest control” triggers additional questions and approvers).
Audit Trail: All actions, comments, and approvals are logged and retained.
Notifications: Automated email notifications to requestors and approvers at each step.
Attachment Support: Allow upload of Client Impact Analysis and other supporting documents.
Reporting: Dashboard for tracking requests, status, and metrics.
4. Workflow Overview
Step 1: Submission
Requestor completes the Immediate Action Approval form (see Appendix 1 for fields).
Form enforces required fields and conditional logic.
Step 2: Initial Routing
If “Within Quest Control” is selected, additional details and corrective action are required.
Routing is determined by ETLO/NLO selection and Quest control status:
ETLO: Route to Katie Bishar (SVP Esoteric Operations)
NLO: Route to SVP National Operations
If “Within Quest Control,” secondary approval by Cathy Doherty (EVP Regional Business) is required.
Step 3: Approvals
Approvers can Approve, Decline, or Request More Information (triggers email to requestor).
If approved, notification sent to requestor and relevant stakeholders.
If declined, routed back to original approver for further action.
Step 4: Documentation & Retention
All requests, approvals, comments, and attachments are stored for audit and compliance.
5. Form Design (Key Fields)
Test Code(s) (table for up to 10 entries)
Test Name(s) (table for up to 10 entries)
Proposed Effective Date or Notice Period (one required)
Impact (Single Site/Enterprise, with lab dropdown if Single Site)
What is changing? (free text)
Within/Outside Quest Control (checkbox, triggers additional fields if “Within”)
Reason for Change (dropdown, dynamic options)
Additional Details (if “Within”)
Who created Client Impact Analysis? (free text, required attachment)
Why can’t Monthly Update be used? (free text)
ETLO/NLO selection (impacts routing)
6. Governance & Audit
All steps, decisions, and supporting documents are logged.
Reports available for compliance, process improvement, and management review.
7. Next Steps
Confirm platform selection (Salesforce, ServiceNow, SharePoint, or other).
Design and prototype the form and workflow.
Pilot with a small group of users and refine.
Roll out to all relevant teams.
Monitor usage and continuously improve based on feedback and metrics
